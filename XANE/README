Naiyun's work logs:

June 09, 2014
I wrote a new version of matlab gui with modification of image display scalebar and display order selection. I added a third axes to display fitting result. I will show it to Karen to fix bug and add exception to control working flow. 
This week plan: finish matlab version and start using python to read data and display the images.
