Naiyun's work logs:

June 09, 2014
I wrote a new version of matlab gui with modification of image display scalebar and display order selection. The third axes displaying fitting result was added. I will show it to Karen to fix bug and add exception to control working flow. 
This week plan: finish matlab version and start using python to read data and display the images.

June 13, 2014
This week, I have fixed all the GUI related bugs in my first version with help of Karen. The work procedure is organized by 'enable' and 'disable' components.

June 20, 2014
This week: added 'xrm' file loading function
           error messages when needed
           put reference plot choices into the listbox
           made 'export spectrum' available to all types of spectrum
           displayed image with any size in axes1
           added 'export Athena' functionality
           installed numpy,scipy,matplotlib,etc.(libraries needed when doing python GUI data processing)
Next week plan: program txrm&xrm file import and image stack display function with PyQT

June 26, 2014
This week: implemented a function of saving fitting tiff image with higher bit depth
           fixed image display colorbar error
           read 'LoadStack' class written in PyQT for loading data
Next week plan: program txrm&xrm file import and image stack display function with PyQT

July 11, 2014
This week: implemented 'Input Data' module by PyQt
           input data in 'txrm' & 'xrm'
           display filepath & filename in the panel
           input reference data in 'txt'
           display corrected image in QGraphicsView
Next week: implement 'Processing' module by PyQt
           learn mantis modules (PCA, clustering, etc.)

July 25, 2014
This week: finished all UI widgets
           widget callback functionality implementation: 
           1) data input and display with grayscale adjust & image number adjust
           2) point & ROI selection and ROI display
	   3) 3 normalization methods
           4) 7 spectrum types plottting (raw_roi, bulk_roi, norm_roi, bulk_roi, ref1, ref2, ref3)
Next week: implement callback functions of fitting part correctly

August 1, 2014
This week: converted all widgests and callback functions from matlab to pyqt
           updated some features in matlab 
Next week: accelarated fitting algorithms
