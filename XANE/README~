Naiyun's work logs:

June 09, 2014
I wrote a new version of matlab gui with modification of image display scalebar and display order selection. The third axes displaying fitting result was added. I will show it to Karen to fix bug and add exception to control working flow. 
This week plan: finish matlab version and start using python to read data and display the images.

This week, I have fixed all the GUI related bugs in my first version with help of Karen. The work procedure is organized by 'enable' and 'disable' components.
