This folder contains several tests of the Epics Channel Access Module.

Most of tthese tests require a set of working Epics Channels to run,
and assume that the epics database 'pyepics.db' (in Setup/) is being
run in some local IOC.

For most test scripts to work completely, the 'simulator.py' script
(in Setup/) should also be running on some system.  For some tests,
the IOC should disconnect and then reconnect -- so you may want to run
a dedicated test IOC for this purpose.

Some tests also use Real, working motors for testing put-waits and
motor configurations.


These are all named in the pvnames.py module, which you may need
to customize in order to properly run these tests.

The tests are not (yet?) very automated, and the results should be
inspected for correctness.
